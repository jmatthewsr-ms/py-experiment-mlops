# Data Science Interview Project

This repository contains a simple data science project that demonstrates a typical machine learning workflow from data preparation to model deployment.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the entire workflow
- `data_preparation.py`: Functions for data generation, exploration, and preparation
- `model_training.py`: Model training and coefficient visualization functionality
- `model_evaluation.py`: Code for evaluating model performance
- `prediction.py`: Utilities for making predictions on new data
- `model_artifacts/`: Directory containing saved model and preprocessing components

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Features

- Synthetic data generation
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training and evaluation
- Making predictions on new data
- Model persistence for future use

## Interview Questions

Throughout the codebase, you'll find interview questions related to production engineering considerations for each phase of the machine learning workflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`
